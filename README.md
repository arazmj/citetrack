## Cloud Computing and Data Analysis 
The pay-as-you-go plan offers adaptability with no upfront costs and no long-term commitment, which makes cloud computing suitable for research projects and prototyping. Instead of investing in expensive hardware and waiting for them to be ordered and delivered, research team can provision their hardware and software needs at a glance. It allows other researchers, or even review peers, to validate your experiment results through services or directly with no hassle[1]. It’s easier to obtain funding for a given project by implementing a prototype of it in cloud with having a credit card at hand and spending only few dollars specially when you are running out of space in your lab and we are not sure that the given project will be even funded or not.  
 
Specifically speaking, Microsoft Azure differs not much in terms of technology compared to other cloud providers on the market. Obviously Microsoft specific technologies and products are better supported but it’s not restricted to them. It offers the same very IaaS thing as Amazon EC2 offers which surprisingly enables one to create non-windows on Microsoft Datacenters.
 
Technology specific speaking, Microsoft Azure allows you to run tasks, namely WebJobs, without having to pay for a VM and OS overhead but demand or on planned-schedules.
There’s some benefits that comes with WebJobs. First of all Azure can recover WebJob in case of failure, e.g twitter rate limits reached, twitter service shutdowns. It also logs the event. Secondly there’s set monitoring tools to monitor the WebJob activities easily, e.g. CPU usage, network usage. I created a WebJob for “Twitter Network Builder Project” be ran on arbitrary time intervals and on each run it fetches data off twitter and stores them in MongoDB. 
 
## Why is it necessary and why you can’t do it without
I believe it’s more a matter of benefits than necessary. I could still use Mono framework on Mac OSX and use my favorite programming language and library. 
Regarding profits: 
I can provision new development environment with pre-installed softwares without having to pay for licenses and going through the process of time-consuming software installation and configuration 
I can keep an eye on my Twitter Network Builder projects from almost everywhere using my smart phone. 
I can scale-out servers or increase my storage and computation power if later on we decided to work more on this project.
You and any other students can check or even my share work. We can even hand Complex Networks students with a template VM, a VM that comes with preinstalled libraries, software and even a working base-code of Data Collector if you want to class to be less technical-oriented.
Microsoft SQL Server Reporting/Analysis/Integration Services are set of tools for BI developers that I’m already familiar with so in case of that tasks such as data cleansing, data visualization, data-mining needed I will be able to do them these tasks quickly and consequently stay focused on research aspect of course. But these software require licenses which we don’t have to pay them on Azure Academic Subscription.
